* fix for path issue on windows [#17][i17] { [melezov][melezov] }
* moving to a new [home][sbtcom]

It was time to pack up so `less-sbt` has moved to it's new home in a bed of ivy thanks to
some generosity of some [friends][typesafe].

This means its also time for you to update your resolvers accordingly. You can install
this plugin as you did before through your plugin definition with

    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "less-sbt" % "0.1.9")

Just be sure to and the sbt community resolver for plugin releases if you do not already

    resolvers += Resolver.url("sbt-plugin-releases",
      new URL("http://scalasbt.artifactoryonline.com/scalasbt/sbt-plugin-releases/"))(
        Resolver.ivyStylePatterns)

And mix it your build definition with

    seq(lessSettings:_*)
