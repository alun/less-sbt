# first release

A nice complement to [coffeescripted-sbt][cs] for front end development.

- Compiles [less][less] to css
- Optinal Built-in minification
- Watchable file change support `~ less`

## settings

    less # compiles less source files
    charset(for less) # character encoding used in file IO (defaults to utf-8)
    mini(for less) # setting for compiled minification (false by default)
    filter(for less) # filter for files included by the plugin
    exclude-filter(for less) # filter for files ignored by the plugin
    unmanaged-sources(for less) # lists resolved less sources
    clean(for less) # deletes compiled css
    config:source-directory(for less) # where less files will be resolved from
    config:resource-managed(for less) # where compiled css will be copied to
    
## install it

In your plugin definition add

    resolvers += "less is" at "http://repo.lessis.me"
    
    addSbtPlugin("me.lessis" % "less-sbt" % "0.1.0")
    
And in your build file add

    seq(lessSettings:_*)
    
This will add less settings for the Compile and Test configurations.

To add it to other configurations, use

    seq(lessSettingsIn(SomeOtherConfig):_*)
